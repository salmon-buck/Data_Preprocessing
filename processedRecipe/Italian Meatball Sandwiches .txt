 1 : Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. 2 : In a large bowl, combine ground beef, shallot, garlic, parsley, bread crumbs, Parmesan and egg. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Roll mixture into 1 1/4-to-1 1/2-inch meatballs, forming about 18-20 meatballs. 3 : Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add meatballs, in batches, and cook until all sides are browned, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. 4 : In a small bowl, whisk together tomato sauce, basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and sugar, if using. 5 : Reduce heat to low and add tomato sauce and meatballs to the skillet, simmering until the sauce has thickened, about 10-15 minutes. 6 : To assemble the sandwich, place 3-4 meatballs and a spoonful of marinara into each baguette. Top with sliced mozzarella and place into oven and bake until the cheese has melted, about 5 minutes. 7 : Serve immediately.
