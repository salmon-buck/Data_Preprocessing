 1 : In a large bowl, combine pork, cabbage, mushrooms, carrot, garlic, green onion, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar and white pepper.*  2 : To assemble the dumplings, place wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal.*  3 : Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add potstickers in a single layer and cook until golden and crisp, about 2-3 minutes per side. 4 : Serve immediately with soy sauce, if desired.
