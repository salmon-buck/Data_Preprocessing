 1 : In a large bowl, combine shrimp, pork, cabbage, green onions, ginger, sesame oil, mirin, salt and pepper, to taste. 2 : To assemble the dumplings, place wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the shrimp mixture into the center of each wrapper. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal. 3 : Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add dumplings in a single layer and cook until golden and crisp, about 2-3 minutes per side. 4 : Serve immediately with soy sauce, if desired.
