 1 : To make the marinade, whisk together chicken stock, soy sauce, honey, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, cornstarch, 1 tablespoon sesame oil and 1/2 cup water in a large bowl. 2 : In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken and 6 tablespoons of the marinade
 marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade. 3 : Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger and chili paste and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in 2 cups marinade until slightly thickened, about 3-4 minutes
 keep warm. 4 : In a large bowl, combine cornstarch, flour, baking soda and remaining marinade until it resembles coarse meal. 5 : Working one at a time, dip the chicken into the egg whites, then dredge in the cornstarch mixture, pressing to coat. 6 : Heat corn oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven to 350 degrees F. Add chicken and fry until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. 7 : Serve chicken immediately, tossed or drizzled with the marinade, garnished with sesame seeds and green onion.
