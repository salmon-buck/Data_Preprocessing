 1 : To make the sauce, whisk together the red wine vinegar, pineapple juice or orange juice, sugar, ketchup, cornstarch and salt in a small bowl, set aside. 2 : In a medium bowl, combine the chicken, soy sauce and vermouth or sherry. 3 : Heat 2 teaspoons canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken mixture and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. 4 : Add remaining 2 teaspoons canola oil to the skillet. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the pineapple until heated through, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, ginger and scallion whites and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chicken, along with any juices, and scallion greens and cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the sauce mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 1-2 minutes. 5 : Serve immediately over rice with Sriracha, if desired.
