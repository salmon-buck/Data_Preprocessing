 1 : Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, set aside. 2 : Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium high heat. Add eggs whisking, until they just begin to set, season with salt and pepper, to taste. Continue cooking until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, about 3-5 minutes, set aside. 3 : Remove rolls from the can, separating them into 4 rectangles, 2 triangles each. Press each rectangle to form a 6Ã—4-inch rectangle, firmly pressing perforations to seal. 4 : Top half of each rectangle with eggs, ham and cheese. Fold dough from the top over the filling, pressing the edges to seal. 5 : Place onto the prepared baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 12-13 minutes.* 6 : Serve immediately.
