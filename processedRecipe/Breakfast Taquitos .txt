Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside. 2 : Working one at a time, transfer tortilla to a work surface, place eggs, sausage, sun dried tomatoes, avocado and cheddar cheese in the center of each wrapper.

Repeat with remaining tortilla and filling. 3 : Place taquitos seam side down onto prepared baking sheet and bake until taquitos are crisp and cheese has melted, about 12-15 minutes. 4 : Serve immediately.
