 1 : Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil. 2 : Pat lamb dry with paper towels. Using a sharp knife, score the top side of the lamb by making shallow cuts all over. 3 : In a small bowl, combine garlic, olive oil, rosemary, thyme, Dijon, salt and pepper. 4 : Place lamb, fat side up, on a rack in the prepared roasting pan. Spread garlic mixture evenly over the lamb, rubbing in thoroughly into the scored cuts. 5 : Place into oven and roast until it reaches an internal temperature of 135 degrees F for medium, about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing. 6 : Serve immediately with mini hasselback potatoes.
