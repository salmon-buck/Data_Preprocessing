 1 : In a large bowl, combine ground chicken, chicken sausage, Panko, Parmesan, egg, oregano, basil, parsley and garlic powder
 season with salt and pepper, to taste. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Roll the mixture into 3/4-to-1-inch meatballs, forming about 25-30 meatballs. 2 : Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add meatballs, in batches, and cook until all sides are browned, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate
 set aside. 3 : Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the stockpot. Add garlic, onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute. 4 : Whisk in chicken stock and bay leaves
 bring to a boil. Stir in acini di pepe, rosemary and meatballs
 reduce heat and simmer until pasta is tender and meatballs are cooked through, about 9-12 minutes. 5 : Stir in spinach, lemon juice and parsley until spinach has wilted, about 2 minutes
 season with salt and pepper, to taste. 6 : Serve immediately, garnished with Parmesan, if desired.
