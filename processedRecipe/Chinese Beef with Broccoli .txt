 1 : In a large bowl, whisk together 1/2 tablespoon (1 1/2 teaspoons) cornstarch, 1 1/2 tablespoons (4 1/2 teaspoons) soy sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1/2 tablespoon (1 1/2 teaspoons) peanut oil. Add the steak and toss to coat

 set aside. 3 : Heat 1 tablespoon peanut oil over high heat in a medium saucepan. Add the ginger, broccoli and remaining 1/2 teaspoon sugar and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes
 transfer to a plate. 4 : Heat 1 more tablespoon peanut oil in the saucepan. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes
 transfer to a plate. (I wanted the onions to be more caramelized and tender so I stir-fried them for a bit longer, about 7 minutes.) 5 : Heat remaining 2 tablespoons peanut oil in the saucepan and reduce heat to medium high. Add the garlic and steak and stir-fry 1 minute. 6 : Whisk the sauce mixture and add to saucepan
 simmer for 1 minute. 7 : Add the broccoli and onion. 8 : Stir until well combined and cook until meat is cooked through, about 3-4 minutes. 9 : Serve with rice, if desired.
