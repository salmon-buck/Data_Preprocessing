 1 : Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 2 : Cut a 6-inch circle of dough for each of the four wide-mouth 8-ounce mason jars. Carefully press the dough onto the bottom and up the sides. 3 : Place parchment paper in each jar to cover the bottom and sides of the jar. Add pie weights on top of parchment and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. 4 : Let cool completely before removing parchment paper and pie weights. 5 : To make the strawberry sauce, combine 1 pound strawberries, sugar and vanilla in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil
 reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened, about 6-10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in lemon zest and let cool for 10 minutes. 6 : To assemble the pies, divide the remaining 1 pound strawberries among the four jars, arranging them within the baked crusts. Drizzle the strawberry sauce evenly over the top until the strawberries are covered with a thin layer. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours for the strawberries to set up. 7 : Serve chilled with a dollop of whipped cream, if desired.
