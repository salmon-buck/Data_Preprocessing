 1 : Heat corn oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. 2 : Season pork chops with salt and pepper, to taste. Working one at a time, dredge pork chops in flour, dip into egg, then dredge in Panko crumbs, pressing to coat. 3 : Working in batches, add pork chops to the skillet, 2 or 3 at a time, and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. 4 : Serve immediately with rice and tonkatsu sauce, if desired.
