 1 : Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Lightly coat a baking sheet or pizza pan with olive oil. 2 : Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. 3 : Stir in mushrooms, thyme and oregano. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and browned, about 5-6 minutes, season with salt and pepper, to taste. 4 : Working on a surface that has been sprinkled with cornmeal, roll out the pizza into a 12-inch-diameter round. Transfer to prepared baking sheet or pizza pan. 5 : Top with mozzarella, dollops of ricotta and mushrooms. 6 : Place into oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheeses have melted. 7 : Serve immediately.
