 1 : Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with foil. 2 : Place bacon in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Place into oven and bake until almost crisp, about 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. 3 : Lightly oil a 12-cup standard muffin tin or coat with nonstick spray. Line each cup with a slice of bread. Place into oven and bake until slightly firm, about 5-6 minutes. 4 : Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in kale until slightly wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in Parmesan, set aside. 5 : Reduce oven to 375 degrees F. 6 : Lay bacon slice in each bread cup, top with kale mixture. Gently crack an egg in each cup, season with salt and pepper, to taste. 7 : Place into oven and bake until egg whites are just set, about 15-20 minutes, or until desired doneness. 8 : Serve immediately, garnished with chives, if desired.
