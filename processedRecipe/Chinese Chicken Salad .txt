 1 : Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 2 : To make the vinaigrette, whisk together rice wine vinegar, garlic, sesame oil, sugar, ginger and soy sauce in a small bowl, set aside. 3 : In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken, soy sauce, sesame oil and white pepper, marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning the bag occasionally. 4 : Add chicken and marinade to a baking dish. Place into oven and bake until cooked through and juices run clear, about 13-15 minutes. Let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces. 5 : To assemble the salad, place romaine lettuce in a large bowl, top with red cabbage, carrots, edamame, green onion and chicken. Pour sesame vinaigrette on top of the salad and gently toss to combine. 6 : Serve immediately, topped with chow mein noodles and almonds, if desired.
