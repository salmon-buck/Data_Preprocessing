 1 : Coarsely chop 1 onion half. Coarsely chop 2 pineapple rounds, discarding core, cover and chill remaining pineapple. Place chopped onion and chopped pineapple in blender. Add orange juice and next 7 ingredients, puree marinade until smooth. Place pork in large resealable plastic bag. Add marinade and seal bag, releasing excess air. Turn to coat. Chill at least 4 hours and up to 1 day. 2 : Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Grill remaining pineapple until warm and slightly charred, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Grill pork with some marinade still clinging until slightly charred and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer pineapple and pork to work surface, chop pineapple into 1/2-inch cubes, discarding cores. Chop pork. Transfer to platter, toss to combine. 3 : Meanwhile, finely chop remaining onion half and place in medium bowl. Add cilantro, toss to combine. Grill tortillas until warm and slightly charred, about 10 seconds per side. 4 : Serve pork-pineapple mixture with onion-cilantro relish, Smoky Two-Chile Salsa, and lime wedges.
