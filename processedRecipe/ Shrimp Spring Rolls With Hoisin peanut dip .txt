 1 : Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2 : To make the dipping sauce, whisk together hoisin, peanut butter, rice vinegar and sesame oil in a small bowl
 set aside. 3 : Place shrimp onto prepared baking sheet. Add olive oil, salt and pepper, to taste, and gently toss to combine.
