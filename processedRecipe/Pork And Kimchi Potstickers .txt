 1 : In a large bowl, combine ground pork, kimchi, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil. 2 : To assemble the potstickers, place wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork-kimchi mixture into the center of each wrapper. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal. 3 : Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add potstickers in a single layer and cook until beginning to crisp on the bottom, about 2-3 minutes. Working quickly, add 1/4 cup water, cover and cook until liquid has evaporated and bottoms of dumplings are crisp and golden, about 3-5 minutes. 4 : Serve immediately.
