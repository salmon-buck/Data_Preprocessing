 1 : Heat vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in crushed peppers and garlic, stirring occasionally, until the oil reaches 180 degrees F, about 8-10 minutes
 set aside. 2 : In a large bowl, combine chicken, cabbage, carrot, garlic, green onions, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, ginger, sesame oil and white pepper.*  3 : To assemble the dumplings, place wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the chicken mixture into the center of each wrapper. Using your finger, rub the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal.* 4 : Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add potstickers in a single layer and cook until golden and crisp, about 2-3 minutes per side. 5 : Serve immediately with hot chili oil sauce.
