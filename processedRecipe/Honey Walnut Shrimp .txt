Add sugar and stir, constantly, until golden and thickened. Add walnuts and gently toss to combine. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined plate. 3 : In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, honey and condensed milk, set aside. 4 : Season shrimp with salt and pepper, to taste. 5 : Working one at a time, dip the shrimp into the egg, then dredge in the cornstarch, pressing to coat. 6 : Working in batches, add the shrimp to the skillet, 8-10 at a time, and fry until evenly golden brown and crispy, about 1-2 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. 7 : In a large bowl, combine shrimp and honey mixture. 8 : Serve immediately, topped with walnuts.
