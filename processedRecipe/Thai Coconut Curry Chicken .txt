 1 : Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. 2 : Season chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. 3 : Melt butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side, drain excess fat and set aside. 4 : In a medium bowl, whisk together coconut milk and cornstarch, set aside. 5 : Add garlic to the skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute. 6 : Whisk in curry paste until well combined, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in coconut milk mixture, and cook, whisking constantly, until incorporated and slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in lime juice, fish sauce, sugar and sugar snap peas. 7 : Return chicken to the skillet. Place into oven and roast until completely cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 25-30 minutes. 8 : Serve immediately, garnished with chili pepper and cilantro, if desired.
