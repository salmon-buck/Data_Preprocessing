 1 : Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2 : Place shrimp onto the prepared baking sheet. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper, to taste, and gently toss to combine. Place into oven and roast just until pink, firm and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool before dicing into bite-size pieces. 3 : Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9Ã—13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray. 4 : Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions become translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cabbage, carrot, spinach, chipotle pepper, oregano and cayenne. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach just begins to wilt, about 1-2 minutes. Add shrimp and gently toss to combine. 5 : To make the sauce, melt butter in a large saucepan. Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1-2 minutes. Gradually whisk in chicken stock and cook, whisking constantly, until incorporated, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in sour cream. Add jalapenos and garlic powder and simmer until the sauce has thickened, about 2 minutes, season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro. 6 : To assemble the enchiladas, lay tortilla on a flat surface and spoon 1/3 cup of the shrimp mixture in the center, sprinkle with cheese. Roll the tortilla and place seam side down onto prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and shrimp mixture. 7 : Pour half of the jalapeno cream sauce evenly over the top. Place into oven and bake, covered, until lightly golden and bubbly, about 20 minutes. 8 : Serve immediately with remaining jalapeno cream sauce, garnished with cilantro.
