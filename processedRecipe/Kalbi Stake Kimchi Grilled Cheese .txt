 1 : In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, green onions, sesame seeds and red pepper. 2 : In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine the Kalbi marinade and steak
 marinate overnight, turning the bag occasionally. 3 : Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the steak and cook, flipping once, until medium rare, about 3-4 minutes per side. Let the meat rest for 5-7 minutes before carving into thin slices. 4 : Heat the panini maker to medium high heat. 5 : To assemble the sandwich, generously spread the butter on 4 slices of bread. On the non-buttered side, top with the steak, kimchi and cheese. Place the remaining bread on top and spread with butter. 6. Grill each sandwich until the cheese is thoroughly melted and the sandwich is golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.
